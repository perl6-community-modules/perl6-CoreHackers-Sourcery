# NAME

CoreHackers::Sourcery - Show source locations of core methods and subs

# SYNOPSIS

```perl6
    use CoreHackers::Sourcery;
    &say.sourcery("foo").put;

    # OUTPUT:
    # src/core/io_operators.pm:22 https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/c843682/src/core/io_operators.pm#L22

    put sourcery Int, 'abs';         # method called on a type object
    put sourcery 42,  'split';       # method called on an Int object
    put sourcery 42,  'base', \(16); # method call with args
```

# DESCRIPTION

------

Update: as of Rakudo v2016.10.286.g.2.e.9.e.89.b, the .line and .file reported
by the methods indicate original files, making this module less useful... but
still working.

------

When calling `.line` or `.file` on core `Code` objects, you get a line
in the setting. The setting is a giant file, so such information is not
ideal when trying to locate the place to edit the code.

This module provides the *actual* location of the sub or method definition
in Rakudo's source code.

# METHODS

## `.sourcery`

```perl6
    &say.sourcery.put;        # location of the `proto`
    &say.sourcery('foo').put; # location of the candidate that can do 'foo'
```

The core `Code` class and its core subclasses get augmented with `.sourcery`
method. Calling this method with no arguments provides the location
of the method or sub, or the `proto` of the multi.

When called with arguments, returns the location of the narrowest candidate,
possibly `die`ing if no candidate can be found.

Returns a list of two strings: the `file:line-number` referring to the
core file and the GitHub URL.

# SUBROUTINES

## `sourcery`

```perl6
    put sourcery &say;              # just Code object
    put sourcery &say, \('foo');    # find best candidate for a Code object
    put sourcery Int, 'abs';        # method `abs` on a type object

    # find best candidate for method `base` on object 42, with argument `16`
    put sourcery 42, 'base', \(16);
```
Operates similar to the method form, except allows more flexibility, such
as passing object/method names.
Returns a list of two strings: the `file:line-number` referring to the
core file and the GitHub URL.

# ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES

## `SOURCERY_SETTING`

The location of the setting file. Defaults to:

```perl6
    $*EXECUTABLE.parent.parent.parent.child(&say.file)
```

This will generally work for most installs.
